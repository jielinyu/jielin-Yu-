I think the second explanation is better. Both explanation gives examples to explain mutability in python data types. In the first explanation, it only uses two sentences what “mutable” means in python. Then, it only gives the example to explain how lists are mutable. Then, when explaining "mutability is different than a mere reassignment of a variable name”, it only uses one sentence to explain it and from this one sentence, I can’t understand what does author mean “reassignment of a variable name”.
In the second explanation, it does a better job. First, it uses clay and stone to metaphor mutability and immutability, which makes me feel more interesting and more understandable. Then, he uses some easy example to show us that list type in python is mutable while tuple type in python is immutable, which first explanation only uses few sentences. Then, instead of explaining in words like the first explanation, he uses example to make me understand the difference between mutability and "reassignment of a variable name".
Also, I notice that in the second explanation, the author often asks a question to lead me think about it, which makes me feel focused on.
